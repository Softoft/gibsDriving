            To find a private driver in the Gambia, start by asking for recommendations at your accommodation or
            from local contacts. Utilize online platforms like TripAdvisor and local Facebook groups to find
            reliable drivers with positive reviews. Ensure clear communication about rates, destinations, and any
            additional services beforehand.
            Hiring a local driver not only supports the local economy but also enriches your travel
            experience by providing insider knowledge of the area. Remember, word of mouth and online reviews are
            key to finding a trustworthy and experienced driver for your journey in the Gambia.
