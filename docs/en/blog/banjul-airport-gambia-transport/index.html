        <p>Traveling to Gambia brings its own set of unique experiences, starting right from the moment you land at the
            Banjul International Airport. This article aims to guide you through the airport procedures, and provide
            useful tips on how to secure a hassle-free airport transfer to your subsequent destination.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Touchdown in Gambia</h2>
        <div class="medium-image">
    <img class="Sirv" alt="Gambia Airport- Plane Landing" data-options="threshold:400"
         data-src="https://softoft.sirv.com/gibs/gambia-international-airport-landing-plane.webp"
         src="https://softoft.sirv.com/gibs/gambia-international-airport-landing-plane.webp?q=1&w=150">
</div>
        <p>After landing, a shuttle bus will ferry you to the main terminal building. It's worth noting that the climate
            inside the airport is generally warm. Therefore, storing your jackets in your carry-on luggage is advisable
            before disembarking. Also, keep your passport, along with all relevant documents, and a pen at hand for easy
            access.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Airport Development Fee</h2>
        <p>The Banjul International Airport levies a development fee of €20/$20/£20 or GMD1000 per person (excluding
            infants). This fee needs to be paid at the Airport Security Tax collection desk.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Immigration Checkpoint</h2>
        <p>Next, you'll be directed to the immigration control section where your passport (with visa if applicable)
            will be checked. You'll be asked to provide your biometrics and pose for a photograph.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Baggage Claim</h2>
        <div class="medium-image">
    <img class="Sirv" alt="Gambia Banjul Airport - Baggage Claim" data-options="threshold:400"
         data-src="https://softoft.sirv.com/gibs/gambia-airport-bagage-claim.webp"
         src="https://softoft.sirv.com/gibs/gambia-airport-bagage-claim.webp?q=1&w=150">
</div>
        <p>Moving ahead, you'll arrive at the luggage carousel area. Be prepared for a bit of a wait here. It's
            advisable to carry water or other drinks in your hand luggage as the temperature may sometimes be
            uncomfortable. Trolleys are provided free of charge; however, if you decide to use a porter's services, be
            ready to tip them around £1/€1.50/$2.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Luggage Security Check</h2>
        <p>After your luggage arrives, proceed to the baggage security queue. Here, your luggage will be scanned by an
            X-ray machine. From this point, you may leave the main building complex. Remember to keep your luggage
            number handy as it may be required at the exit area.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Departing from the Airport</h2>

</div>

        <p>Once you exit the airport, you'll have multiple options for your airport transfer.</p>
        <h3>Tour Operators</h3>
        <p>If you've arrived with a tour operator, you will usually exit to the right of the main gate, where your coach
            will be waiting to transfer you to your resort.</p>
        <h3>Independent Travel</h3>
        <p>If you're an independent traveler, you can hire a car from a company located at the terminal or opt for one
            of the tourist taxis waiting outside the main gates. The cost to reach the main tourist resorts on the coast
            is typically around GMD1500/£18/€20/$23.</p>
