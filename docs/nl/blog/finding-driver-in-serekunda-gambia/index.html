        <p>The traffic in Gambia, and especially in areas like Serekunda, is known for its lively streets and unique
            driving etiquette. Vehicles keep to the right side of the road, and while main roads are generally in good
            condition, side streets and rural roads can be challenging without a local driver's expertise. Here are a
            few
            key aspects to keep in mind:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Urban areas can get quite congested, especially during peak hours.</li>
            <li>Local driving customs might differ from what you're used to, emphasizing the value of a knowledgeable
                local driver.
            </li>
            <li>Road conditions vary significantly from paved roads in cities to unpaved tracks in rural areas.</li>
