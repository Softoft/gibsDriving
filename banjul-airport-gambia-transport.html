        <h2>Touchdown in Gambia</h2>
        <p>After landing, a shuttle bus will ferry you to the main terminal building. It's worth noting that the climate
            inside the airport is generally warm. Therefore, storing your jackets in your carry-on luggage is advisable
            before disembarking. Also, keep your passport, along with all relevant documents, and a pen at hand for easy
            access.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Baggage Claim</h2>
        <p>Moving ahead, you'll arrive at the luggage carousel area. Be prepared for a bit of a wait here. It's
            advisable to carry water or other drinks in your hand luggage as the temperature may sometimes be
            uncomfortable. Trolleys are provided free of charge; however, if you decide to use a porter's services, be
            ready to tip them around £1/€1.50/$2.</p>

        <h2>Luggage Security Check</h2>
        <p>After your luggage arrives, proceed to the baggage security queue. Here, your luggage will be scanned by an
            X-ray machine. From this point, you may leave the main building complex. Remember to keep your luggage
            number handy as it may be required at the exit area.</p>

        <h2>Departing from the Airport</h2>

            will be waiting to transfer you to your resort.</p>
        <h3>Independent Travel</h3>
        <p>If you're an independent traveler, you can hire a car from a company located at the terminal or opt for one
            of the tourist taxis waiting outside the main gates. The cost to reach the main tourist resorts on the coast
            is typically around GMD1500/£18/€20/$23.</p>
